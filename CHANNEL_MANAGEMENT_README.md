## Usage Instructions

### 1. CSV Upload with Channel Data
Upload a CSV file with a "Channel" column containing values like:
- LinkedIn
- Email
- Phone
- SMS
- WhatsApp

Example CSV structure:

Name,Email,LinkedIn,Company,Title,Phone,Channel,Industry,Location
John Smith,john@example.com,https://linkedin.com/in/johnsmith,Tech Corp,Software Engineer,+1234567890,LinkedIn,Technology,San Francisco
```

### 2. Using Channel From Dropdown
1. Navigate to Master Table
2. Select a contact row
3. Use the "Channel From" dropdown to select communication method
4. Status dropdown will automatically update with relevant sequence
5. Changes sync instantly with backend

### 3. Status Management
- Status options change dynamically based on Channel From selection
- LinkedIn and Email have specific 10-step sequences
- Other channels use default CRM workflow
- All status changes trigger next action calculations

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified
- `src/components/ui/master-table.tsx` - Added channel columns and dynamic dropdowns
- `src/lib/status-config.ts` - Channel-specific status sequences
- `src/components/ui/csv-processor.tsx` - Enhanced channel detection
- `supabase/migrations/20250825050000_add_channel_from_column.sql` - Database schema

### Database Functions Updated
- `calculate_next_action()` - Uses channel_from for calculations
- `update_next_action_on_status_change()` - Handles channel-based triggers
- `get_next_action_text()` - Channel-aware action text

## Migration Required
Run the following to apply database changes:
```bash
npx supabase db reset
# or
npx supabase db push
```
